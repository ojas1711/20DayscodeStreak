      <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
      <p>HTML5 will be the new standard for HTML.</p>
      <p>The previous version of HTML, HTML 4.01, came in 1999. The internet has changed significantly since then.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is designed to deliver almost everything you want to do online 
        without requiring additional plugins. It does 
        everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to 
        build complicated applications that run in your browser.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is also cross-platform (it does not care whether 
        you are using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or a 
        Smart TV).</p>
      <p>HTML5 can also be used to write web applications that still work when you are not 
        online.</p>
      <p>The HTML 5 working group includes AOL, Apple, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mozilla, Nokia, Opera, and hundreds 
        of other vendors.</p>
      <p>HTML5 is still a work in progress. However, all major browsers support many 
        of the new HTML5 elements and APIs.</p>

      <h2>CSS3 Modules</h2>
      <p>CSS3 has been split into &quot;modules&quot;. It contains the &quot;old CSS specification&quot; 
        (which has 
        been split into smaller pieces). In addition, new modules are added.</p>
      <p>Some of the most important CSS3 
        modules are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Selectors</li>
        <li>Box Model</li>
        <li>Backgrounds and Borders</li>
        <li>Image Values and Replaced Content</li>
        <li>Text Effects</li>
        <li>2D/3D Transformations</li>
        <li>Animations</li>
        <li>Multiple Column Layout</li>
        <li>User Interface</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2>CSS3
        Recommendation</h2>
      <p>The CSS3 specification is still under development by W3C.</p>
      <p>However, many of the new CSS3 properties have been implemented in modern 
        browsers.</p>

      <h3>What Exactly Is JavaScript?:</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It runs on your visitor's computer and doesn't require constant downloads from your website. JavaScript is often used to create polls and quizzes.</p>
      
      <h3>Are JavaScript and Java the Same?:</h3>
      
      <p>No, they are two completely different computer languages. Only their names are similar. If you want to learn about Java instead, we have a whole other resource section on <a href="#">Java</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>What Do I Need to Run JavaScript?:</h3>
      
      <p>JavaScript support is built right into all the major web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. Provided that the visitors to your site are using web browsers that support JavaScript (most do) and have JavaScript enabled (it is by default), then your JavaScript will run when they visit the page.</p>
      
      <h3>Do I Need to Learn Javascript to Be Able to Use It?:</h3>
      
      <p>No. There are plenty of pre-written JavaScripts that people have made available for you to plug straight into your web page. All you need to know to be able to use such scripts is how to <a href="#">paste</a> the supplied code into the required places in your web page.</p>
      
      <h3>What Do I Need to Write JavaScript?:</h3>
      
      <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language, so no special program is required to create usable code. Any plain text editor such as Notepad (one of the Accessories that comes in Windows) is quite satisfactory for being able to write JavaScript. That said, an editor that colorizes the code to make it easier to see what is what makes it easier to find your mistakes. My <a href="#">Javascript Formatter</a> also can reformat your script to make errors easier to spot.</p>
      
      <h3>Can I Use HTML Instead of JavaScript?:</h3>
      
      <p>No. HTML and JavaScript are two completely different things. HTML is a markup language designed for defining static web page content. JavaScript is a programming language designed for performing dynamic tasks. Sometimes the distinction is confusing because JavaScript code can go in the same file as HTML. (More on that in a minute.)</p>
      
      <h3>Can I Use PHP or Some Other Server-Side Language Instead of JavaScript?:</h3>
      
      <p>Perhaps. It depends where the code needs to run. If it can run before the page loads, you can use a server-side language. If it has to run after the page has loaded, then you must use JavaScript, as this is the only scripting language supported by all web browsers that support client-side scripting.</p>
      
      <h3>Does the Javascript Go in the Same File as the HTML?:</h3>
      
      <p>It can, but your scripts will be more easily reused on multiple pages of your site if you place them in separate files. (Using a .JS extension helps identify them as Javascript.) You then just link the JavaScript to your HTML by inserting a &lt;script&gt; tag. The same JavaScript can then be added to several pages just by adding the appropriate tag into each of the pages to set up the link.</p>

      <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
      <p>jQuery is a lightweight, &quot;write less, do more&quot;, JavaScript library.</p>
      <p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
      <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish,
        and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
      <p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
      <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
        <li>CSS manipulation</li>
        <li>HTML event methods</li>
        <li>Effects and animations</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Tip:</b> In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>
      <hr>
      
      <h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
      <p>There are lots of other JavaScript frameworks out there, but jQuery seems 
        to be the most popular, and also the most extendable.</p>
      <p>Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google</li>
        <li>Microsoft</li>
        <li>IBM</li>
        <li>Netflix</li>
      </ul>
